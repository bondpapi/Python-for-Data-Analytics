You were also introduced to visualization packages, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. Now is time to combine these skills into an DA project. Your task is to analyze data with Python and create a notebook, where you can show your Python and analytical skills.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"crazy-mercury","metadata":{"id":"crazy-mercury"},"source":["## The Minimum Requirements for the Graded Task\n","* Use Python data types: a list, a dictionary, an array, a dataframe.\n","* Use Python functions to work with a dataset: join, filter, delete elements, etc.\n","* Use Numpy and Pandas packages.\n","* Use at least one package for visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.\n","* Use at least 3 different charts in your project.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cross-tiger","metadata":{"id":"cross-tiger"},"source":["A part of your project is to choose a problem to analyze and find a dataset.
